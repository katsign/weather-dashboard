## *Description*

Following closely with the given acceptance criteria, I built a minimalist in-browser weather app that searches by city using [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/). I used everything I've learned about coding so far to build an HTML shell, populate it with DOM manipulation, and style the end result with a new-to-me CSS framework, [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/).

## *Demo*

Search by City            |  Forecast View
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![Demo of Weather Dashboard](./assets/screenshots/kc1.png)  |  ![Demo of Weather Dashboard](./assets/screenshots/kc2.png)

#### These images show the browser view for the search, "Kansas City." Users are met with a search input that will trigger an API call for that city, retrieving the current weather and the next five days' forecasts.

Search History            |  Start / Empty
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

#### The user can then search as many queries as they want as long as they are using the city name, and when finished browsing, clear the saved searches from the Search History list.
